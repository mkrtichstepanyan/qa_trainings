Complete tasks and learning materials referring to Inheritance, overloading and overriding mechanisms

CODING TASK

A. OVERLOADING
1. Create class Calculations create method getMean(Arguments) (միջին թվաբանական)
    The method should
    1.1. Work with any number of int, double, float parameters(using method overloading)
    and return arithmetic mean (միջին թվաբանական) for provided numbers in parameters
    1.2 If String is provided as a parameter it should return concatenation of all Strings
    e. g. if provided parameters are "Happy", "New", "Year" it should return "HappyNewYear"

    Create examples of calls in class Math

B. INHERITANCE AND OVERRIDING
1. Create 3 classes: Staff(abstract), Developer(extends Staff) and QualityEngineer(extends Staff)
2. Staff should have fields Name, Surname, static field company(String, can be predefined), methods getName/LastName
setName/LastName(String parameter), abstract method doWork, static method getCompany
3. Developer should extend class Staff, have field techstack (String field, java, php etc), doWork implementation should
print developers name and tech stack, setters and getters for all fields
4. QualityEngineer should extend class Staff, have field type(String field manual/automation/security etc), doWork implementation
should print engineer's name and type
5. For both classes getCompany method's output should be "{developer/engineerName} is from: "companyName"}"

Create instances of both classes in separate class Work under function main

MARKING CRITERIA
1. Minimum possible access modifier is used for each field/method
2. Getters and setters are created for all possible fields
3. Methods mentioned above should have their calls in Math/Work classes

After finishing the work
1. Create new folder "name_surname" inside ./javaClasses.homework_4
2. Copy create class and classes "Work" "Math" into that folder
3. Create new branch "<name>_<surname>_java_classes_homework_4"
4. Create Pull Request/Merge Request and assign to Volodya Kotsinyan(volodya11) or Mkrtich Stepanyan
